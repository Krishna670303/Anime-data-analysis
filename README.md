# Anime-data-analysis
This project focuses on analyzing anime-related data to extract meaningful insights using Python data analysis techniques. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to understand trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset.

### Objectives

Understand the structure and quality of the dataset

Clean and preprocess raw data

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Identify trends, distributions, and correlations

Visualize insights using graphs and plots

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains information related to anime shows, such as:

Anime titles

Ratings and popularity

Genres and categories

Number of episodes

Viewer-related metrics

Note: The dataset may contain missing values, duplicates, or inconsistent formats, which are handled during the data cleaning phase.

### Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas – data manipulation

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

🔄 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading

Imported the dataset using Pandas

Inspected rows, columns, and data types

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Removed duplicates

Fixed incorrect or inconsistent data

Converted data types where required

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions of ratings and popularity

Studied genre-wise trends

Compared numerical features

Identified outliers and patterns

4️⃣ Data Visualization

Bar charts for categorical data

Histograms for numerical distributions

Box plots for outlier detection

Heatmaps for correlation analysis

### Key Insights

Certain genres dominate in terms of popularity and ratings

Ratings tend to cluster within specific ranges

Some features show strong correlations

Outliers significantly affect average values

### Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the end-to-end data analysis process, starting from raw data to actionable insights. It highlights the importance of data cleaning before analysis and shows how visualization helps in understanding complex data easily.
